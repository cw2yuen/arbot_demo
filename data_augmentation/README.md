# Data Augmentation for Arbo Dental Care AI Agent

This system allows you to augment the AI agent's knowledge base with commonly asked dental questions and answers that may not be covered on the website.

## üìÅ Files

- **`dental_qa_template.csv`** - Template CSV file with pre-filled common dental Q&A
- **`merge_qa_data.py`** - Script to merge CSV data with existing JSON
- **`README.md`** - This documentation file

## üöÄ How to Use

### Step 1: Customize the CSV Template

1. **Open** `dental_qa_template.csv` in Excel, Google Sheets, or any CSV editor
2. **Edit** the existing Q&A pairs to match Arbo Dental Care's specific policies
3. **Add** new Q&A pairs based on common patient questions
4. **Save** the file

### Step 2: CSV Format

The CSV has 5 columns:

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `question` | The patient's question | "What are your office hours?" |
| `answer` | Your detailed answer | "Our office hours are Monday to Friday..." |
| `category` | Question category | "hours", "insurance", "treatments" |
| `source` | Data source | "manual" (for manually added data) |
| `priority` | Importance level | "high", "medium", "low" |

### Step 3: Run the Merger

```bash
python data_augmentation/merge_qa_data.py
```

This will:
- Load your CSV data
- Merge it with existing website data
- Create `arbo_dental_data_augmented.json`
- Show analysis of the merged data

### Step 4: Rebuild Knowledge Base

```bash
python data_preparation/knowledge_base.py
```
