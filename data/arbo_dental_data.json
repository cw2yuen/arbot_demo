Their GENUINE CARE and ATTENTION are evident each time you interact with the office, whether by phone or in person at the facility.\r\n\r\nDr. Pham is a ONE-OF-A-KIND dental professional. Not only does he possess exceptional skills and knowledge, but he is also dedicated to staying up-to-date on the latest advancements in the field. His meticulous approach and willingness to explain procedures from start to finish set him apart and give you the confidence needed as a patient.\r\n\r\nThere was one occasion in which I could not wait to have an appointment so I took the chance to go to another dental office. Gross Mistake Ever. In pain, I reached out to Arbo Dental, where Dr. Pham and Christina provided prompt, thorough and comprehensive care that alleviated not only my pain but also my concerns. This experience reaffirmed my confidence in their expertise and compassion. After what I had been through with the previous dental office I know now that I am not taking chances again and always going back to Arbo D.C.\r\n\r\nI am IMMENSELY GRATEFUL to the entire team at Arbo Dental Care for their professionalism and personable approach. If you are seeking dental care that surpasses expectations, look no further – you will find it here at Arbo Dental Care.\r\n\r\nI wholeheartedly recommend Arbo Dental Care to anyone looking for EXCEPTIONAL DENTAL SERVICES <3GooglearrowBackEMEmilia M.Dr. Pham is very thorough and walked me through everything he was planning to do. He even showed me before pictures of the affected area and after pictures too. The staff is friendly and efficient. I would definitely recommend Arbo Dental.GooglearrowBackVLVicki L.I've been with Arbo Dental since I moved to Bradford almost 20 years ago. The staff has always treated me kindly, and when my boys started going, they are very comfortable with everyone. I would highly recommend this team for anyone looking for a family dentist. Dr. Chan showed patience to my boys, and now Dr. Pham has been a welcome addition.GooglearrowBackRKRoman K.Great place to get your teeth fixed! :-) My whole family has been going to Arbo Dental for 15 years, and all the staff has always been super professional, courteous, and accommodating. They really try to make those uncomfortable moments as comfortable as possible. I wish the whole healthcare system would run as professionally as Arbo Dental. They will even put a game on for you if you ask. :-) 100% recommended.GooglearrowBackBBBradford B.Dr. Pham and all the staff are very friendly and professional. Time is taken to explain things in detail, and efforts to assist go beyond what is normally expected at a dentist's office. I truly feel that they care about more than my dental health, and great efforts have been made to assist in this manner. I highly recommend this office.GooglearrowBackKVKaren V.I have been going to Arbo Dental office for well over 20 years. Every time I’ve been, the quality of care and professional service is top-notch! The beautiful ladies Carol, Christina, and Nola are stellar at their individual roles in the office, and I always receive the best customer service, kindness, and professionalism. Dr. Pham takes a personal interest in your health and well-being and educates you on why certain things happen but kindly reassures you of how he’ll help, how to prevent, and a treatment plan for the future. I always feel like I’m in good hands and never feel pressured. So grateful to them all for the consistent and excellent quality of care I’ve received over the years!GooglearrowBackTNTina N.Dr. Pham and his staff are very personable and professional. We always have a good laugh, and they are always so accommodating. It has been a great experience.GooglearrowBackADAndrew D.I have been going to Dr. Chan’s dentistry since I was a little kid who was terrified of the dentist; when I learned it would transition to Dr. Pham, I was a little hesitant as I had the utmost confidence in Mr. Chan after using him for as long as I can remember. After a few visits now, I have that same confidence in Dr. Pham! He is patient, very explanatory, knowledgeable, and easy to talk to; his use of the iPhone camera to put photos of your teeth onto the TV screens in each room so you can see in-depth what he is referring to is also very helpful! I had a dental implant procedure this year which required numerous visits to make\r\nsure everything was healing properly and we could proceed to next steps\r\naccordingly. Dr. Pham and his team made sure I was always comfortable throughout\r\nthe procedures and followed up with me to make sure I was doing okay more then\r\nmy mom LOL; their level of care is truly unmatched!\r\n\r\nI very much enjoy that the office staff have also stayed the same through the\r\ntransition; Christina, Carol & Nola have watched me grow up throughout the years\r\nand very much helped me grow out of being fearful of the dentist . They are very kind,\r\npersonable, highly knowledgeable and provide me with recommendations I know I\r\ncan ALWAYS trust!\r\n\r\nFor anybody looking for a new dentist I would not hesitate to recommend ARBO!\r\nThanks again and see you for my next cleaning!\"GooglearrowBackSSScott S.I can say without a doubt that I will not go anywhere else regarding my teeth. Dr. Pham and his staff are incredible. The experience, technology, and skill set are second to none, period..... I'm dropping the 🎤. For all you do ❤ ScottyGooglearrowBackSASabrina A.I am very picky when it comes to dentists. Honestly, I wish I had switched to them sooner. The whole team is friendly and professional. Absolutely wonderful front staff, hygienist, and dentist. Dr. Pham takes time to answer questions, and I never feel rushed. He explains things thoroughly before and while working and teaches preventive measures for the best dental results. Wish I could rate them with more stars.GooglearrowBackRLRoger L.I have been a patient at ARBO since the early days of opening under Dr. Chan. I was\r\nsad to hear he was leaving and somewhat skeptical about a new Dentist coming in.\r\nMy skepticism was quickly eliminated my first interaction with Dr Pham.\r\nHe was friendly, professional, very thorough, explained the issue, took pics and\r\nshowed me what he saw, a refreshing approach! He then took the time to explain\r\nthroughly the corrective procedure and immediately was able to put me at ease.\r\nMy daughters had previously switched to a dentist in Barrie where we live for\r\nconvenience sake. You know kids, closer to home is better. Long story short they\r\nhave recently come back to ARBO and have been thrilled with the service and overall\r\nexperience since coming back. They even commented to me how amazing Dr. Pham\r\nhas been, he did additional research n and issue and even called my daughter to\r\nprovide new information over the phone. In my estimation he went over and above.\r\nAs for the staff at ARBO, Carol, Nola and Christina, they have been the constant over\r\nthe years and have provide nothing short of AMAZING service to me and my family.\r\nWould recommend ARBO for all of your dental needs without hesitation.ChevronChevronCOMFORTABLEYour experience and comfort at your appointment is important to us.

Their GENUINE CARE and ATTENTION are evident each time you interact with the office, whether by phone or in person at the facility.\r\n\r\nDr. Pham is a ONE-OF-A-KIND dental professional. Not only does he possess exceptional skills and knowledge, but he is also dedicated to staying up-to-date on the latest advancements in the field. His meticulous approach and willingness to explain procedures from start to finish set him apart and give you the confidence needed as a patient.\r\n\r\nThere was one occasion in which I could not wait to have an appointment so I took the chance to go to another dental office. Gross Mistake Ever. In pain, I reached out to Arbo Dental, where Dr. Pham and Christina provided prompt, thorough and comprehensive care that alleviated not only my pain but also my concerns. This experience reaffirmed my confidence in their expertise and compassion. After what I had been through with the previous dental office I know now that I am not taking chances again and always going back to Arbo D.C.\r\n\r\nI am IMMENSELY GRATEFUL to the entire team at Arbo Dental Care for their professionalism and personable approach. If you are seeking dental care that surpasses expectations, look no further – you will find it here at Arbo Dental Care.\r\n\r\nI wholeheartedly recommend Arbo Dental Care to anyone looking for EXCEPTIONAL DENTAL SERVICES <3GooglearrowBackEMEmilia M.Dr. Pham is very thorough and walked me through everything he was planning to do. He even showed me before pictures of the affected area and after pictures too. The staff is friendly and efficient. I would definitely recommend Arbo Dental.GooglearrowBackVLVicki L.I've been with Arbo Dental since I moved to Bradford almost 20 years ago. The staff has always treated me kindly, and when my boys started going, they are very comfortable with everyone. I would highly recommend this team for anyone looking for a family dentist. Dr. Chan showed patience to my boys, and now Dr. Pham has been a welcome addition.GooglearrowBackRKRoman K.Great place to get your teeth fixed! :-) My whole family has been going to Arbo Dental for 15 years, and all the staff has always been super professional, courteous, and accommodating. They really try to make those uncomfortable moments as comfortable as possible. I wish the whole healthcare system would run as professionally as Arbo Dental. They will even put a game on for you if you ask. :-) 100% recommended.GooglearrowBackBBBradford B.Dr. Pham and all the staff are very friendly and professional. Time is taken to explain things in detail, and efforts to assist go beyond what is normally expected at a dentist's office. I truly feel that they care about more than my dental health, and great efforts have been made to assist in this manner. I highly recommend this office.GooglearrowBackKVKaren V.I have been going to Arbo Dental office for well over 20 years. Every time I’ve been, the quality of care and professional service is top-notch! The beautiful ladies Carol, Christina, and Nola are stellar at their individual roles in the office, and I always receive the best customer service, kindness, and professionalism. Dr. Pham takes a personal interest in your health and well-being and educates you on why certain things happen but kindly reassures you of how he’ll help, how to prevent, and a treatment plan for the future. I always feel like I’m in good hands and never feel pressured. So grateful to them all for the consistent and excellent quality of care I’ve received over the years!GooglearrowBackTNTina N.Dr. Pham and his staff are very personable and professional. We always have a good laugh, and they are always so accommodating. It has been a great experience.GooglearrowBackADAndrew D.I have been going to Dr. Chan’s dentistry since I was a little kid who was terrified of the dentist; when I learned it would transition to Dr. Pham, I was a little hesitant as I had the utmost confidence in Mr. Chan after using him for as long as I can remember. After a few visits now, I have that same confidence in Dr. Pham! He is patient, very explanatory, knowledgeable, and easy to talk to; his use of the iPhone camera to put photos of your teeth onto the TV screens in each room so you can see in-depth what he is referring to is also very helpful! I had a dental implant procedure this year which required numerous visits to make\r\nsure everything was healing properly and we could proceed to next steps\r\naccordingly. Dr. Pham and his team made sure I was always comfortable throughout\r\nthe procedures and followed up with me to make sure I was doing okay more then\r\nmy mom LOL; their level of care is truly unmatched!\r\n\r\nI very much enjoy that the office staff have also stayed the same through the\r\ntransition; Christina, Carol & Nola have watched me grow up throughout the years\r\nand very much helped me grow out of being fearful of the dentist . They are very kind,\r\npersonable, highly knowledgeable and provide me with recommendations I know I\r\ncan ALWAYS trust!\r\n\r\nFor anybody looking for a new dentist I would not hesitate to recommend ARBO!\r\nThanks again and see you for my next cleaning!\"GooglearrowBackSSScott S.I can say without a doubt that I will not go anywhere else regarding my teeth. Dr. Pham and his staff are incredible. The experience, technology, and skill set are second to none, period..... I'm dropping the 🎤. For all you do ❤ ScottyGooglearrowBackSASabrina A.I am very picky when it comes to dentists. Honestly, I wish I had switched to them sooner. The whole team is friendly and professional. Absolutely wonderful front staff, hygienist, and dentist. Dr. Pham takes time to answer questions, and I never feel rushed. He explains things thoroughly before and while working and teaches preventive measures for the best dental results. Wish I could rate them with more stars.GooglearrowBackRLRoger L.I have been a patient at ARBO since the early days of opening under Dr. Chan. I was\r\nsad to hear he was leaving and somewhat skeptical about a new Dentist coming in.\r\nMy skepticism was quickly eliminated my first interaction with Dr Pham.\r\nHe was friendly, professional, very thorough, explained the issue, took pics and\r\nshowed me what he saw, a refreshing approach! He then took the time to explain\r\nthroughly the corrective procedure and immediately was able to put me at ease.\r\nMy daughters had previously switched to a dentist in Barrie where we live for\r\nconvenience sake. You know kids, closer to home is better. Long story short they\r\nhave recently come back to ARBO and have been thrilled with the service and overall\r\nexperience since coming back. They even commented to me how amazing Dr. Pham\r\nhas been, he did additional research n and issue and even called my daughter to\r\nprovide new information over the phone. In my estimation he went over and above.\r\nAs for the staff at ARBO, Carol, Nola and Christina, they have been the constant over\r\nthe years and have provide nothing short of AMAZING service to me and my family.\r\nWould recommend ARBO for all of your dental needs without hesitation.ChevronChevronCOMFORTABLEYour experience and comfort at your appointment is important to us.

Their GENUINE CARE and ATTENTION are evident each time you interact with the office, whether by phone or in person at the facility.\r\n\r\nDr. Pham is a ONE-OF-A-KIND dental professional. Not only does he possess exceptional skills and knowledge, but he is also dedicated to staying up-to-date on the latest advancements in the field. His meticulous approach and willingness to explain procedures from start to finish set him apart and give you the confidence needed as a patient.\r\n\r\nThere was one occasion in which I could not wait to have an appointment so I took the chance to go to another dental office. Gross Mistake Ever. In pain, I reached out to Arbo Dental, where Dr. Pham and Christina provided prompt, thorough and comprehensive care that alleviated not only my pain but also my concerns. This experience reaffirmed my confidence in their expertise and compassion. After what I had been through with the previous dental office I know now that I am not taking chances again and always going back to Arbo D.C.\r\n\r\nI am IMMENSELY GRATEFUL to the entire team at Arbo Dental Care for their professionalism and personable approach. If you are seeking dental care that surpasses expectations, look no further – you will find it here at Arbo Dental Care.\r\n\r\nI wholeheartedly recommend Arbo Dental Care to anyone looking for EXCEPTIONAL DENTAL SERVICES <3GooglearrowBackEMEmilia M.Dr. Pham is very thorough and walked me through everything he was planning to do. He even showed me before pictures of the affected area and after pictures too. The staff is friendly and efficient. I would definitely recommend Arbo Dental.GooglearrowBackVLVicki L.I've been with Arbo Dental since I moved to Bradford almost 20 years ago. The staff has always treated me kindly, and when my boys started going, they are very comfortable with everyone. I would highly recommend this team for anyone looking for a family dentist. Dr. Chan showed patience to my boys, and now Dr. Pham has been a welcome addition.GooglearrowBackRKRoman K.Great place to get your teeth fixed! :-) My whole family has been going to Arbo Dental for 15 years, and all the staff has always been super professional, courteous, and accommodating. They really try to make those uncomfortable moments as comfortable as possible. I wish the whole healthcare system would run as professionally as Arbo Dental. They will even put a game on for you if you ask. :-) 100% recommended.GooglearrowBackBBBradford B.Dr. Pham and all the staff are very friendly and professional. Time is taken to explain things in detail, and efforts to assist go beyond what is normally expected at a dentist's office. I truly feel that they care about more than my dental health, and great efforts have been made to assist in this manner. I highly recommend this office.GooglearrowBackKVKaren V.I have been going to Arbo Dental office for well over 20 years. Every time I’ve been, the quality of care and professional service is top-notch! The beautiful ladies Carol, Christina, and Nola are stellar at their individual roles in the office, and I always receive the best customer service, kindness, and professionalism. Dr. Pham takes a personal interest in your health and well-being and educates you on why certain things happen but kindly reassures you of how he’ll help, how to prevent, and a treatment plan for the future. I always feel like I’m in good hands and never feel pressured. So grateful to them all for the consistent and excellent quality of care I’ve received over the years!GooglearrowBackTNTina N.Dr. Pham and his staff are very personable and professional. We always have a good laugh, and they are always so accommodating. It has been a great experience.GooglearrowBackADAndrew D.I have been going to Dr. Chan’s dentistry since I was a little kid who was terrified of the dentist; when I learned it would transition to Dr. Pham, I was a little hesitant as I had the utmost confidence in Mr. Chan after using him for as long as I can remember. After a few visits now, I have that same confidence in Dr. Pham! He is patient, very explanatory, knowledgeable, and easy to talk to; his use of the iPhone camera to put photos of your teeth onto the TV screens in each room so you can see in-depth what he is referring to is also very helpful! I had a dental implant procedure this year which required numerous visits to make\r\nsure everything was healing properly and we could proceed to next steps\r\naccordingly. Dr. Pham and his team made sure I was always comfortable throughout\r\nthe procedures and followed up with me to make sure I was doing okay more then\r\nmy mom LOL; their level of care is truly unmatched!\r\n\r\nI very much enjoy that the office staff have also stayed the same through the\r\ntransition; Christina, Carol & Nola have watched me grow up throughout the years\r\nand very much helped me grow out of being fearful of the dentist . They are very kind,\r\npersonable, highly knowledgeable and provide me with recommendations I know I\r\ncan ALWAYS trust!\r\n\r\nFor anybody looking for a new dentist I would not hesitate to recommend ARBO!\r\nThanks again and see you for my next cleaning!\"GooglearrowBackSSScott S.I can say without a doubt that I will not go anywhere else regarding my teeth. Dr. Pham and his staff are incredible. The experience, technology, and skill set are second to none, period..... I'm dropping the 🎤. For all you do ❤ ScottyGooglearrowBackSASabrina A.I am very picky when it comes to dentists. Honestly, I wish I had switched to them sooner. The whole team is friendly and professional. Absolutely wonderful front staff, hygienist, and dentist. Dr. Pham takes time to answer questions, and I never feel rushed. He explains things thoroughly before and while working and teaches preventive measures for the best dental results. Wish I could rate them with more stars.GooglearrowBackRLRoger L.I have been a patient at ARBO since the early days of opening under Dr. Chan. I was\r\nsad to hear he was leaving and somewhat skeptical about a new Dentist coming in.\r\nMy skepticism was quickly eliminated my first interaction with Dr Pham.\r\nHe was friendly, professional, very thorough, explained the issue, took pics and\r\nshowed me what he saw, a refreshing approach! He then took the time to explain\r\nthroughly the corrective procedure and immediately was able to put me at ease.\r\nMy daughters had previously switched to a dentist in Barrie where we live for\r\nconvenience sake. You know kids, closer to home is better. Long story short they\r\nhave recently come back to ARBO and have been thrilled with the service and overall\r\nexperience since coming back. They even commented to me how amazing Dr. Pham\r\nhas been, he did additional research n and issue and even called my daughter to\r\nprovide new information over the phone. In my estimation he went over and above.\r\nAs for the staff at ARBO, Carol, Nola and Christina, they have been the constant over\r\nthe years and have provide nothing short of AMAZING service to me and my family.\r\nWould recommend ARBO for all of your dental needs without hesitation.ChevronChevronCOMFORTABLEYour experience and comfort at your appointment is important to us.

He even showed me before pictures of the affected area and after pictures too. The staff is friendly and efficient. I would definitely recommend Arbo Dental.GooglearrowBackVLVicki L.I've been with Arbo Dental since I moved to Bradford almost 20 years ago. The staff has always treated me kindly, and when my boys started going, they are very comfortable with everyone. I would highly recommend this team for anyone looking for a family dentist. Dr. Chan showed patience to my boys, and now Dr. Pham has been a welcome addition.GooglearrowBackRKRoman K.Great place to get your teeth fixed! :-) My whole family has been going to Arbo Dental for 15 years, and all the staff has always been super professional, courteous, and accommodating. They really try to make those uncomfortable moments as comfortable as possible. I wish the whole healthcare system would run as professionally as Arbo Dental. They will even put a game on for you if you ask. :-) 100% recommended.GooglearrowBackBBBradford B.Dr. Pham and all the staff are very friendly and professional. Time is taken to explain things in detail, and efforts to assist go beyond what is normally expected at a dentist's office. I truly feel that they care about more than my dental health, and great efforts have been made to assist in this manner. I highly recommend this office.GooglearrowBackKVKaren V.I have been going to Arbo Dental office for well over 20 years. Every time I’ve been, the quality of care and professional service is top-notch! The beautiful ladies Carol, Christina, and Nola are stellar at their individual roles in the office, and I always receive the best customer service, kindness, and professionalism. Dr. Pham takes a personal interest in your health and well-being and educates you on why certain things happen but kindly reassures you of how he’ll help, how to prevent, and a treatment plan for the future. I always feel like I’m in good hands and never feel pressured. So grateful to them all for the consistent and excellent quality of care I’ve received over the years!GooglearrowBackTNTina N.Dr. Pham and his staff are very personable and professional. We always have a good laugh, and they are always so accommodating. It has been a great experience.GooglearrowBackADAndrew D.I have been going to Dr. Chan’s dentistry since I was a little kid who was terrified of the dentist; when I learned it would transition to Dr. Pham, I was a little hesitant as I had the utmost confidence in Mr. Chan after using him for as long as I can remember. After a few visits now, I have that same confidence in Dr. Pham! He is patient, very explanatory, knowledgeable, and easy to talk to; his use of the iPhone camera to put photos of your teeth onto the TV screens in each room so you can see in-depth what he is referring to is also very helpful! I had a dental implant procedure this year which required numerous visits to make\r\nsure everything was healing properly and we could proceed to next steps\r\naccordingly. Dr. Pham and his team made sure I was always comfortable throughout\r\nthe procedures and followed up with me to make sure I was doing okay more then\r\nmy mom LOL; their level of care is truly unmatched!\r\n\r\nI very much enjoy that the office staff have also stayed the same through the\r\ntransition; Christina, Carol & Nola have watched me grow up throughout the years\r\nand very much helped me grow out of being fearful of the dentist . They are very kind,\r\npersonable, highly knowledgeable and provide me with recommendations I know I\r\ncan ALWAYS trust!\r\n\r\nFor anybody looking for a new dentist I would not hesitate to recommend ARBO!\r\nThanks again and see you for my next cleaning!\"GooglearrowBackSSScott S.I can say without a doubt that I will not go anywhere else regarding my teeth. Dr. Pham and his staff are incredible. The experience, technology, and skill set are second to none, period..... I'm dropping the 🎤. For all you do ❤ ScottyGooglearrowBackSASabrina A.I am very picky when it comes to dentists. Honestly, I wish I had switched to them sooner. The whole team is friendly and professional. Absolutely wonderful front staff, hygienist, and dentist. Dr. Pham takes time to answer questions, and I never feel rushed. He explains things thoroughly before and while working and teaches preventive measures for the best dental results. Wish I could rate them with more stars.GooglearrowBackRLRoger L.I have been a patient at ARBO since the early days of opening under Dr. Chan. I was\r\nsad to hear he was leaving and somewhat skeptical about a new Dentist coming in.\r\nMy skepticism was quickly eliminated my first interaction with Dr Pham.\r\nHe was friendly, professional, very thorough, explained the issue, took pics and\r\nshowed me what he saw, a refreshing approach! He then took the time to explain\r\nthroughly the corrective procedure and immediately was able to put me at ease.\r\nMy daughters had previously switched to a dentist in Barrie where we live for\r\nconvenience sake. You know kids, closer to home is better. Long story short they\r\nhave recently come back to ARBO and have been thrilled with the service and overall\r\nexperience since coming back. They even commented to me how amazing Dr. Pham\r\nhas been, he did additional research n and issue and even called my daughter to\r\nprovide new information over the phone. In my estimation he went over and above.\r\nAs for the staff at ARBO, Carol, Nola and Christina, they have been the constant over\r\nthe years and have provide nothing short of AMAZING service to me and my family.\r\nWould recommend ARBO for all of your dental needs without hesitation.ChevronChevronCOMFORTABLEYour experience and comfort at your appointment is important to us.

Their GENUINE CARE and ATTENTION are evident each time you interact with the office, whether by phone or in person at the facility.\r\n\r\nDr. Pham is a ONE-OF-A-KIND dental professional. Not only does he possess exceptional skills and knowledge, but he is also dedicated to staying up-to-date on the latest advancements in the field. His meticulous approach and willingness to explain procedures from start to finish set him apart and give you the confidence needed as a patient.\r\n\r\nThere was one occasion in which I could not wait to have an appointment so I took the chance to go to another dental office. Gross Mistake Ever. In pain, I reached out to Arbo Dental, where Dr. Pham and Christina provided prompt, thorough and comprehensive care that alleviated not only my pain but also my concerns. This experience reaffirmed my confidence in their expertise and compassion. After what I had been through with the previous dental office I know now that I am not taking chances again and always going back to Arbo D.C.\r\n\r\nI am IMMENSELY GRATEFUL to the entire team at Arbo Dental Care for their professionalism and personable approach.

Every time I’ve been, the quality of care and professional service is top-notch! The beautiful ladies Carol, Christina, and Nola are stellar at their individual roles in the office, and I always receive the best customer service, kindness, and professionalism. Dr. Pham takes a personal interest in your health and well-being and educates you on why certain things happen but kindly reassures you of how he’ll help, how to prevent, and a treatment plan for the future. I always feel like I’m in good hands and never feel pressured.

We always have a good laugh, and they are always so accommodating. It has been a great experience.GooglearrowBackADAndrew D.I have been going to Dr. Chan’s dentistry since I was a little kid who was terrified of the dentist; when I learned it would transition to Dr. Pham, I was a little hesitant as I had the utmost confidence in Mr. Chan after using him for as long as I can remember. After a few visits now, I have that same confidence in Dr. Pham! He is patient, very explanatory, knowledgeable, and easy to talk to; his use of the iPhone camera to put photos of your teeth onto the TV screens in each room so you can see in-depth what he is referring to is also very helpful! I had a dental implant procedure this year which required numerous visits to make\r\nsure everything was healing properly and we could proceed to next steps\r\naccordingly. Dr. Pham and his team made sure I was always comfortable throughout\r\nthe procedures and followed up with me to make sure I was doing okay more then\r\nmy mom LOL; their level of care is truly unmatched!\r\n\r\nI very much enjoy that the office staff have also stayed the same through the\r\ntransition; Christina, Carol & Nola have watched me grow up throughout the years\r\nand very much helped me grow out of being fearful of the dentist . They are very kind,\r\npersonable, highly knowledgeable and provide me with recommendations I know I\r\ncan ALWAYS trust!\r\n\r\nFor anybody looking for a new dentist I would not hesitate to recommend ARBO!\r\nThanks again and see you for my next cleaning!\"GooglearrowBackSSScott S.I can say without a doubt that I will not go anywhere else regarding my teeth. Dr. Pham and his staff are incredible. The experience, technology, and skill set are second to none, period..... I'm dropping the 🎤. For all you do ❤ ScottyGooglearrowBackSASabrina A.I am very picky when it comes to dentists. Honestly, I wish I had switched to them sooner. The whole team is friendly and professional. Absolutely wonderful front staff, hygienist, and dentist. Dr. Pham takes time to answer questions, and I never feel rushed. He explains things thoroughly before and while working and teaches preventive measures for the best dental results. Wish I could rate them with more stars.GooglearrowBackRLRoger L.I have been a patient at ARBO since the early days of opening under Dr. Chan. I was\r\nsad to hear he was leaving and somewhat skeptical about a new Dentist coming in.\r\nMy skepticism was quickly eliminated my first interaction with Dr Pham.\r\nHe was friendly, professional, very thorough, explained the issue, took pics and\r\nshowed me what he saw, a refreshing approach! He then took the time to explain\r\nthroughly the corrective procedure and immediately was able to put me at ease.\r\nMy daughters had previously switched to a dentist in Barrie where we live for\r\nconvenience sake. You know kids, closer to home is better. Long story short they\r\nhave recently come back to ARBO and have been thrilled with the service and overall\r\nexperience since coming back. They even commented to me how amazing Dr. Pham\r\nhas been, he did additional research n and issue and even called my daughter to\r\nprovide new information over the phone. In my estimation he went over and above.\r\nAs for the staff at ARBO, Carol, Nola and Christina, they have been the constant over\r\nthe years and have provide nothing short of AMAZING service to me and my family.\r\nWould recommend ARBO for all of your dental needs without hesitation.ChevronChevronCOMFORTABLEYour experience and comfort at your appointment is important to us.
