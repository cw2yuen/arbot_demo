Their GENUINE CARE and ATTENTION are evident each time you interact with the office, whether by phone or in person at the facility.\r\n\r\nDr. Pham is a ONE-OF-A-KIND dental professional. Not only does he possess exceptional skills and knowledge, but he is also dedicated to staying up-to-date on the latest advancements in the field. His meticulous approach and willingness to explain procedures from start to finish set him apart and give you the confidence needed as a patient.\r\n\r\nThere was one occasion in which I could not wait to have an appointment so I took the chance to go to another dental office. Gross Mistake Ever. In pain, I reached out to Arbo Dental, where Dr. Pham and Christina provided prompt, thorough and comprehensive care that alleviated not only my pain but also my concerns. This experience reaffirmed my confidence in their expertise and compassion. After what I had been through with the previous dental office I know now that I am not taking chances again and always going back to Arbo D.C.\r\n\r\nI am IMMENSELY GRATEFUL to the entire team at Arbo Dental Care for their professionalism and personable approach. If you are seeking dental care that surpasses expectations, look no further – you will find it here at Arbo Dental Care.\r\n\r\nI wholeheartedly recommend Arbo Dental Care to anyone looking for EXCEPTIONAL DENTAL SERVICES <3GooglearrowBackEMEmilia M.Dr. Pham is very thorough and walked me through everything he was planning to do. He even showed me before pictures of the affected area and after pictures too. The staff is friendly and efficient. I would definitely recommend Arbo Dental.GooglearrowBackVLVicki L.I've been with Arbo Dental since I moved to Bradford almost 20 years ago. The staff has always treated me kindly, and when my boys started going, they are very comfortable with everyone. I would highly recommend this team for anyone looking for a family dentist. Dr. Chan showed patience to my boys, and now Dr. Pham has been a welcome addition.GooglearrowBackRKRoman K.Great place to get your teeth fixed! :-) My whole family has been going to Arbo Dental for 15 years, and all the staff has always been super professional, courteous, and accommodating. They really try to make those uncomfortable moments as comfortable as possible. I wish the whole healthcare system would run as professionally as Arbo Dental. They will even put a game on for you if you ask. :-) 100% recommended.GooglearrowBackBBBradford B.Dr. Pham and all the staff are very friendly and professional. Time is taken to explain things in detail, and efforts to assist go beyond what is normally expected at a dentist's office. I truly feel that they care about more than my dental health, and great efforts have been made to assist in this manner. I highly recommend this office.GooglearrowBackKVKaren V.I have been going to Arbo Dental office for well over 20 years. Every time I’ve been, the quality of care and professional service is top-notch! The beautiful ladies Carol, Christina, and Nola are stellar at their individual roles in the office, and I always receive the best customer service, kindness, and professionalism. Dr. Pham takes a personal interest in your health and well-being and educates you on why certain things happen but kindly reassures you of how he’ll help, how to prevent, and a treatment plan for the future. I always feel like I’m in good hands and never feel pressured. So grateful to them all for the consistent and excellent quality of care I’ve received over the years!GooglearrowBackTNTina N.Dr. Pham and his staff are very personable and professional. We always have a good laugh, and they are always so accommodating. It has been a great experience.GooglearrowBackADAndrew D.I have been going to Dr. Chan’s dentistry since I was a little kid who was terrified of the dentist; when I learned it would transition to Dr. Pham, I was a little hesitant as I had the utmost confidence in Mr. Chan after using him for as long as I can remember. After a few visits now, I have that same confidence in Dr. Pham! He is patient, very explanatory, knowledgeable, and easy to talk to; his use of the iPhone camera to put photos of your teeth onto the TV screens in each room so you can see in-depth what he is referring to is also very helpful! I had a dental implant procedure this year which required numerous visits to make\r\nsure everything was healing properly and we could proceed to next steps\r\naccordingly. Dr. Pham and his team made sure I was always comfortable throughout\r\nthe procedures and followed up with me to make sure I was doing okay more then\r\nmy mom LOL; their level of care is truly unmatched!\r\n\r\nI very much enjoy that the office staff have also stayed the same through the\r\ntransition; Christina, Carol & Nola have watched me grow up throughout the years\r\nand very much helped me grow out of being fearful of the dentist . They are very kind,\r\npersonable, highly knowledgeable and provide me with recommendations I know I\r\ncan ALWAYS trust!\r\n\r\nFor anybody looking for a new dentist I would not hesitate to recommend ARBO!\r\nThanks again and see you for my next cleaning!\"GooglearrowBackSSScott S.I can say without a doubt that I will not go anywhere else regarding my teeth. Dr. Pham and his staff are incredible. The experience, technology, and skill set are second to none, period..... I'm dropping the 🎤. For all you do ❤ ScottyGooglearrowBackSASabrina A.I am very picky when it comes to dentists. Honestly, I wish I had switched to them sooner. The whole team is friendly and professional. Absolutely wonderful front staff, hygienist, and dentist. Dr. Pham takes time to answer questions, and I never feel rushed. He explains things thoroughly before and while working and teaches preventive measures for the best dental results. Wish I could rate them with more stars.GooglearrowBackRLRoger L.I have been a patient at ARBO since the early days of opening under Dr. Chan. I was\r\nsad to hear he was leaving and somewhat skeptical about a new Dentist coming in.\r\nMy skepticism was quickly eliminated my first interaction with Dr Pham.\r\nHe was friendly, professional, very thorough, explained the issue, took pics and\r\nshowed me what he saw, a refreshing approach! He then took the time to explain\r\nthroughly the corrective procedure and immediately was able to put me at ease.\r\nMy daughters had previously switched to a dentist in Barrie where we live for\r\nconvenience sake. You know kids, closer to home is better. Long story short they\r\nhave recently come back to ARBO and have been thrilled with the service and overall\r\nexperience since coming back. They even commented to me how amazing Dr. Pham\r\nhas been, he did additional research n and issue and even called my daughter to\r\nprovide new information over the phone. In my estimation he went over and above.\r\nAs for the staff at ARBO, Carol, Nola and Christina, they have been the constant over\r\nthe years and have provide nothing short of AMAZING service to me and my family.\r\nWould recommend ARBO for all of your dental needs without hesitation.ChevronChevronCOMFORTABLEYour experience and comfort at your appointment is important to us.

To restore the tooth’s strength and function crowns are needed to make the tooth last longer so you can enjoy your favourite foods and not worry about what you can eat."

Our registered dental hygienist will perform a thorough dental cleaning.Read MorearrowDental Hygiene AppointmentsDental cleanings with exams every 6 months is recommended for maintaining healthy teeth and gums.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlaque and tartar can form in many areas and they can be difficult to remove if they have started to build up. Hardened plaque is called tartar or calculus. It requires specialized instruments to remove by your dental hygienist or dentist.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExams are an important time to discuss your oral health concerns with your dentist and to assess for issues.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe recommend our patients to schedule their patients ahead of time to ensure you have an appointment that works for you. Send us an emailinfo@arbodentalcare.comor call us for your appointment(905) 775-7377.Restoring to a Healthy SmileWhen treating a tooth becomes necessary, whether it has chipped or has a cavity, our goal is to restore the tooth to its natural colour, shape and function. With all the advances in modern dentistry available to us, we have a number of great ways to do this for you.More InformationarrowRestoring to a Healthy SmileRestorations and FillingsIf teeth start to break down from bacteria, cavities form. Treatment requires removal of the bacteria and decayed tooth structure; the space left behind needs to be replaced.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt Arbo Dental Care, when teeth require fillings, we restore teeth to its natural shape and function with tooth-coloured materials.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEarly cavities can be monitored, but if left untreated it will progress deeper, risking damage to the tooth nerve which can cause pain or infection.Crowns and VeneersWhen teeth have had a history of large fillings, we will assess if the tooth is at high risk of fracture. Some fractures can be unpredictable and render the tooth non-restorable. Ceramic crowns can protect a tooth by covering the whole tooth. Molar and premolar teeth are the highest risk of fracturing due to your bite forces.Root canal therapyRoot canal therapy is a common procedure to save a tooth. The purpose of root canal therapy is to eliminate pain caused by an infected tooth nerve. When the nerve of a tooth is infected by bacteria through deep cavities or decay, it can cause pain, swelling, or infection. It is important to visit us because this infection can spread quickly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAfter diagnostic tests have confirmed the need for root canal therapy, a small access is made into the nerve chamber of the tooth. Then, the area is disinfected and the bacteria is removed along with the nerve of the tooth (called the pulp). After disinfection, the pulp space is filled with a sealer and root canal filling material. A definitive filling is placed inside the tooth until a crown can be placed onto the tooth to prevent tooth fracture.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease give us a call at(905) 775-7377or send us an email toinfo@arbodentalcare.comfor your consultation appointment with Dr. David Pham.Dental ImplantsThere have been amazing advancements in replacing missing teeth, restoring function and your smile. A long-term solution is now available with dental implants.For a consultation with Dr. Pham, please call(905) 775-7377.More InformationarrowDental ImplantsDental ImplantsDental implants are a great way to replace missing teeth. Dental implants use medical grade titanium implants placed into the upper or lower jaw, and a final crown is placed on the titanium implant.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe titanium implant acts as the “root” of the tooth, and the crown is the part that is visible in the mouth which you can chew on and smile with.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDental implants are incredibly strong and closely match the function and esthetics of natural teeth and cannot get dental cavities, however they can still be at risk of gum disease. Follow-up appointments are required.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe timeline of a simple dental implant procedure can be divided into several appointments.\r\nThe first appointment involves an initial consultation and treatment planning. The second appointment is to place the dental implant and a 2-week follow up. After 4-6 months of healing, you will attend the third and fourth appointment to make the crown on top of the implant.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt every stage you will be re-assessed before moving to the next phase.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt is important to return for follow-ups, maintaining proper oral hygiene, and regular appointments for cleanings and exams before and after dental implant therapy.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease give us a call at(905) 775-7377or send us an emailinfo@arbodentalcare.comfor your consultation appointment with Dr. David Pham to see if you are a candidate for dental implants.Removable DenturesRemovable dentures are used to replace multiple missing teeth to restore some function and esthetics. There are two main types: partial dentures or full dentures. They must be removed every night and cleaned at home.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf we have determined that dentures will work best for you, the timeline will involve the initial consultation, minimal teeth modification if needed and a final mould or impression will be sent to the lab to fabricate your denture. At this time we may discuss the esthetics and what to expect when your denture returns and we try them in. It is normal to take some time to get used to using dentures, and adjustments will be required. After a while, you will be able to start chewing with them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEven though dentures rest on your gums and teeth, it still traps food and bacteria. It is very important to maintain your oral hygiene and to see us regularly for your dental cleanings and exams.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDentures tend to wear down or loosen over time due to several factors including diet and whether you grind or clench your teeth. Most patients replace their dentures after 5 years.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease give us a call at(905) 775-7377or send us an emailinfo@arbodentalcare.comfor your consultation appointment with Dr. David Pham to see if you are a candidate for dentures.SedationWe have sedation options to support you if you feel anxious before your dental appointment.Conscious sedation is a great way for patients to relax and feel comfortable during their appointment. You would be conscious of your surroundings and be able to communicate with your dentist. This is a great option to help those that are anxious during dental appointments, and also understand it is important to complete their treatment.Your Sedation Dentistry OptionsarrowSedationNitrous Oxide GasAlso known as laughing gas, nitrous oxide is an effective way to have a calm, comfortable and conscious appointment with its sedative effect. After nitrous oxide sedation, you will be able to go home on your own and you will be able to remember how relaxed and comfortable you were during the appointment.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDuring the appointment you will constantly be monitored by your dental team to make sure you’re comfortable.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNitrous oxide is best for patients that are hesitant with more deeper forms of sedation such as intravenous (IV) sedation or general anesthesia (fully unconscious).Oral SedationOral sedation is another option to help you relax during your dental appointment. It is a prescription medication taken with our supervision before your appointment. It is an effective way to achieve a minimal level of conscious sedation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith oral sedation, we ask that you have someone close to you take you home after your appointment because its sedative effect lingers after the appointment is over.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt is normal to not remember your dental appointment due to the medication.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease give us a call at(905) 775-7377or send us an emailinfo@arbodentalcare.comto see which sedation option is best for you.Wisdom Tooth ExtractionsAt Arbo Dental Care Bradford we can help with wisdom teeth extractions when they need to be removed or before they cause pain or infection.More InformationarrowWisdom Tooth ExtractionsWisdom teeth are removed because of the lack of space and the likelihood of tooth impaction in future years. Impacted teeth are blocked from erupting normally, which can negatively affect teeth around them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen wisdom teeth are removed at younger age, there are fewer complications, quicker healing, and less post-operative discomfort.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSeveral concerns with leaving wisdom teeth include possible crowding, infections, pain, loss of adjacent teeth, cavities, localized gum disease and bone loss.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf your wisdom teeth are bothering you or your child, or if you’re wondering if you are a candidate for wisdom teeth removal, please give us a call at(905) 775-7377or send us an emailinfo@arbodentalcare.comSame Day Dental Crowns - One AppointmentSame-day treatment is possible at Arbo Dental Care Bradford.

Unlike tooth decay caused by bacteria, acid erosion occurs when acids directly attack your tooth enamel, gradually wearing away this protective outer layer. Understanding the causes, symptoms, and prevention strategies can help you maintain healthy teeth for life.What Is Acid Erosion of Teeth?Acid erosion, also known as dental erosion or enamel erosion, is the irreversible loss of tooth structure caused by chemical dissolution from acids. These acids can come from food, beverages, medications, or even your own stomach acid. When the pH level in your mouth drops below 5.5, your tooth enamel begins to soften and dissolve.The process is gradual but relentless. Each time your teeth are exposed to acid, the enamel becomes temporarily weakened. With repeated exposure, this protective layer thins and eventually wears away completely, exposing the underlying dentin layer.Common Causes of Dental Acid ErosionDietary Acids– The most frequent culprits of acid erosion come from what we eat and drink:– Citrus fruits and juices contain high levels of citric acid. While nutritious, frequent consumption of oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruit can contribute to enamel loss.– Soft drinks and sodas are particularly damaging due to their combination of phosphoric acid, citric acid, and sugar. Even diet sodas contain acids that can erode teeth.– Sports drinks and energy drinks often contain citric acid and other erosive substances, making them surprisingly harmful to dental health.– Wine and alcoholic beverages can be acidic, with white wine being particularly erosive due to its tartaric and malic acid content.– Vinegar-based foods such as pickles, salad dressings, and certain condiments can contribute to acid exposure.Medical Conditions– Several health conditions can increase acid erosion risk:– Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) causes stomach acid to flow back into the mouth, creating a highly acidic environment that damages teeth.– Bulimia nervosa involves frequent vomiting, which exposes teeth to stomach acid and can cause severe erosion patterns.– Frequent heartburn can also introduce stomach acid into the oral cavity.Medications– Certain medications can increase erosion risk by reducing saliva production or increasing acid levels in the mouth.Recognizing the Signs and SymptomsEarly detection of acid erosion is crucial for preventing further damage. Watch for these warning signs:Visual Changes– Tooth transparency and thinning: Teeth may appear more translucent, especially along the biting edges– Yellowing: As enamel thins, the yellow dentin underneath becomes more visible– Rounded teeth: Sharp edges become smooth and rounded– Cupping: Small dents or cups may appear on the biting surfaces– Cracks: Teeth may develop small cracks or chips more easilyPhysical Symptoms– Increased sensitivity: Teeth may become sensitive to hot, cold, or sweet foods and beverages– Discoloration: Teeth may appear yellow, gray, or stained– Rough texture: The tooth surface may feel rough or uneven to the tongueThe Stages of Acid ErosionUnderstanding the progression of acid erosion can help you recognize when to seek professional help:Stage 1:Initial Enamel SofteningThe enamel becomes temporarily soft after acid exposure but can remineralize with proper care.Stage 2:Enamel ThinningRepeated acid attacks cause permanent enamel loss, leading to increased transparency and sensitivity.Stage 3:Dentin ExposureThe underlying dentin becomes exposed, causing significant sensitivity and discoloration.Stage 4:Severe Structural LossAdvanced erosion can lead to significant tooth structure loss, requiring extensive dental treatment.Prevention Strategies for Acid ErosionDietary Modifications– Limit acidic foods and beverages: Reduce consumption of citrus fruits, sodas, sports drinks, and wine.– Use a straw: When drinking acidic beverages, use a straw to minimize contact with teeth.– Time your consumption: Avoid sipping acidic drinks throughout the day. Instead, consume them during meals when saliva production is increased.– Choose alternatives: Replace acidic beverages with water, milk, or herbal teas.Oral Hygiene Best Practices– Wait before brushing: After consuming acidic foods or drinks, wait at least 30-60 minutes before brushing to allow enamel to reharden.– Use fluoride toothpaste: Fluoride helps strengthen enamel and can promote remineralization.– Rinse with water: Swish with water after consuming acidic substances to help neutralize acids.– Chew sugar-free gum: This stimulates saliva production, which helps neutralize acids and promote remineralization.Lifestyle Changes– Manage acid reflux: Work with your physician to control GERD or frequent heartburn.– Stay hydrated: Adequate water intake helps maintain healthy saliva production.– Regular dental checkups: Professional monitoring can catch early signs of erosion before they become severe.Treatment Options for Acid ErosionEarly Stage Treatment– Fluoride treatments: Professional fluoride applications can help strengthen weakened enamel.– Desensitizing treatments: Special toothpastes or in-office treatments can reduce sensitivity.– Dietary counseling: Your dentist can provide personalized advice on reducing acidic exposure.Advanced Treatment– Dental bonding: Composite resin can be applied to protect exposed dentin and restore tooth shape.– Veneers: Porcelain veneers can cover severely eroded front teeth while protecting remaining structure.– Crowns: Extensive erosion may require crowns to restore function and appearance.– Inlays and onlays: These restorations can rebuild lost tooth structure while preserving healthy tissue.The Role of Saliva in Preventing ErosionSaliva plays a crucial role in protecting teeth from acid erosion. It helps neutralize acids, provides minerals for remineralization, and washes away harmful substances. Conditions that reduce saliva production, such as certain medications or medical conditions, can increase erosion risk.To maintain healthy saliva production:– Stay well-hydrated– Avoid alcohol and tobacco– Chew sugar-free gum– Discuss medication side effects with your healthcare providerWhen to See Your DentistSchedule a dental appointment if you notice:– Increased tooth sensitivity– Changes in tooth color or transparency– Rough or uneven tooth surfaces– Frequent heartburn or acid reflux– Signs of wear on your teeth– Early intervention can prevent minor erosion from becoming a major problem requiring extensive treatment.Protecting Your Family’s Oral HealthAcid erosion can affect people of all ages, but children and teenagers may be at higher risk due to dietary habits and developing oral hygiene routines. Educate your family about:– The importance of limiting acidic drinks– Proper timing of oral hygiene– Signs of dental problems to watch for– The value of regular dental checkupsConclusionAcid erosion of teeth is a serious but preventable condition that can significantly impact your oral health and quality of life.

Common examplesare foods/drinks that would stain a white t-shirt will also stain ourteeth, that includes berries, red wine, pop, coffee, smoking, curry, acidicfoods etc.So if you intend to whiten your teeth consider modifying or limiting theseitems. Drinking red wine every night will definitely reduce effectivenessof any teeth whitening routine. A modification with berries would be tomake a smoothie and drink with a straw or eat with a spoon. Otherwise youwill not get the most out of your teeth whitening routine!With whitening toothpastes, most of them work by using physical abrasives.We have to be careful with teeth that have gum recession or root exposure.The surface of the tooth root is softer than the enamel, so we have toavoid any attempt to whiten the root or brush the root.Want to start your teeth whitening journey? We can start with scheduling adental cleaning 🙂Stay tuned for more informative dental content!Caring for you and your smileArbo Dental Care TeamContact Us Today!(905) 775-7377info@arbodentalcare.com157 Holland St. EastUnit #202 (2nd Floor),Box 511Bradford, ON L3Z 2B1Arbo BlogFollow UsfacebookinstagramWe speak your language:EnglishPortugueseSpanishVietnamese© 2025 Arbo Dental Care | Online Advantage byRoosterGrin Media|Click for AccessibilityREQUEST APPOINTMENTREQUEST AN APPOINTMENTcloseFirst Name *Your first name is required.Last Name *Your last name is required.Your Email Address *Please input a valid EmailYour Phone Number *Please input a valid numberYes, I am a first time patient!MessagePlease fill out your messageSubmit✓closeThank you!We will be in touch shortly!FREE eBOOK Dentistry For KidsDOWNLOAD OUR FREE eBOOKDentistry For KidscloseFirst Name *Your first name is required.Last Name *Your last name is required.Your Email Address *Please input a valid EmailSubmit✓closeThank you!We will be in touch shortly!"

Instead of using metal brackets, wires, and elastics, Invisalign uses custom-made plastic that can move teeth into a better position. There are still benefits of using braces, for example for kids﻿Invisalign at Arbo Dental Care Bradford is a simple process starting with the consultation and scan with our special camera, we review the simulation together, and we start seeing you every 6-12 weeks during your Invisalign journey!A few questions we’ve had before:What can you eat? You can still eat most foods! Fewer food restrictions than braces.How long does it take? 12-18 months for active treatment. You will need to wear retainers after you’re done!Are they noticeable to other people? They’re almost completely invisible, take a look around at work, school and see if you notice anyone wearing them.If you want to learn more visit us atwww.arbodentalcare.com/proceduresIf you want to get in touch:www.arbodentalcare.com/contactandinfo@arbodentalcare.comCaring for you and your smile,Arbo Dental Care BradfordContact Us Today!(905) 775-7377info@arbodentalcare.com157 Holland St. EastUnit #202 (2nd Floor),Box 511Bradford, ON L3Z 2B1Arbo BlogFollow UsfacebookinstagramWe speak your language:EnglishPortugueseSpanishVietnamese© 2025 Arbo Dental Care | Online Advantage byRoosterGrin Media|Click for AccessibilityREQUEST APPOINTMENTREQUEST AN APPOINTMENTcloseFirst Name *Your first name is required.Last Name *Your last name is required.Your Email Address *Please input a valid EmailYour Phone Number *Please input a valid numberYes, I am a first time patient!MessagePlease fill out your messageSubmit✓closeThank you!We will be in touch shortly!FREE eBOOK Dentistry For KidsDOWNLOAD OUR FREE eBOOKDentistry For KidscloseFirst Name *Your first name is required.Last Name *Your last name is required.Your Email Address *Please input a valid EmailSubmit✓closeThank you!We will be in touch shortly!"

We know from dental research that once cavities/bacteria/acid reach the nerve of a tooth, the long-term survival of that tooth is much shorter than a natural cavity-free tooth.",

For each of the causes of xerostomia, there are different approaches to help however a few things you can do are to drink more water, try a saliva-substitute such as Biotene, or a saliva-stimulating lozenge such as Xylimelts.

Cavities form at an acid concentration of approximately pH 5-5.5 in saliva. During the day when we’re not eating, saliva pH is approximately 6.5-7. As a result, when we eat our saliva pH can drop below 5.5 and demineralization can occur of the teeth. If there are more demineralization phases during the day, and for longer periods of time, it stands to reason the risk of cavities would also increase. In order to buffer this change in acidity, drinking water can literally buffer this change along with rinsing the teeth and gums of food debris and bacteria. On the mindset side, it’s important to address these food items when you’re at the store and considering purchasing processed foods, making the change at that level will make a big difference."

On average, the entire process may take anywhere from a few months to a couple of years. Regular dental visits can help track the progress of your wisdom teeth and ensure timely intervention if needed.",
          "Understanding the age at which wisdom teeth emerge, the necessity of their removal, the duration of their emergence, and the signs indicating potential issues is crucial for maintaining optimal oral health. Regular dental check-ups and proactive communication with your dentist are essential for addressing wisdom teeth concerns promptly. If you’re experiencing any discomfort or have concerns about your wisdom teeth, schedule a dental consultation to ensure a healthy and pain-free smile.",

A lot of sports have physical protection such as helmets. In our opinion in any sport in which you wear a helmet, a mouthguard should be considered as well.Recently, we saw a soccer player going for a header, and instead of hitting the ball, the other player headbutted him square in the mouth. Thankfully, our patient did not get a concussion. Unfortunately, our patient had braces on and the impact of the headbutt went towards the lips against the braces, and dislodged a couple teeth. There was a lot of damage to the lips, and the teeth were close to not being saveable. The damage could have been a lot less if a mouthguard was worn at the time.In Bradford, soccer is one of the most popular sports along with hockey, but mouthguards are not enforced like it is in hockey. At Arbo Dental Care Bradford, we encourage everyone that plays sports to wear mouthguards, especially sports that require helmets, such as baseball/softball.We get it, what are the chances of getting hit in the mouth? It’s more common than you think and when you least expect it. When it does happen, there is a lot of panic, anxiety, pain, bleeding, loss of teeth.If you have any questions about mouthguards for sports or night time grinding, contact us by email info@arbodentalcare.com and call 905-775-7377.Caring for you and your smile,Arbo Dental Care TeamContact Us Today!(905) 775-7377info@arbodentalcare.com157 Holland St. EastUnit #202 (2nd Floor),Box 511Bradford, ON L3Z 2B1Arbo BlogFollow UsfacebookinstagramWe speak your language:EnglishPortugueseSpanishVietnamese© 2025 Arbo Dental Care | Online Advantage byRoosterGrin Media|Click for AccessibilityREQUEST APPOINTMENTREQUEST AN APPOINTMENTcloseFirst Name *Your first name is required.Last Name *Your last name is required.Your Email Address *Please input a valid EmailYour Phone Number *Please input a valid numberYes, I am a first time patient!MessagePlease fill out your messageSubmit✓closeThank you!We will be in touch shortly!FREE eBOOK Dentistry For KidsDOWNLOAD OUR FREE eBOOKDentistry For KidscloseFirst Name *Your first name is required.Last Name *Your last name is required.Your Email Address *Please input a valid EmailSubmit✓closeThank you!We will be in touch shortly!"

        "type": "p",
        "text": "1. Preventing Further Damage:The benefit of treating the thin, brittle enamel edge at this stage is to prevent further chipping of the edge – so instead of chipping more of the tooth, the bonding material would chip instead. There are microcracks that we don’t want to propagate, as they do not heal/seal on their own."
      },
      {
        "type": "p",
        "text": "2. Restoring Functionality:A chipped tooth can affect your ability to bite, chew, and speak properly. How many times has your tongue kept playing with a new filling, crown, or otherwise? The same can happen when a tooth is chipped – the tongue won’t leave it alone! By filling the chipped area, a dentist can restore the natural feel and function. This ensures that you can resume normal function without discomfort or limitations, allowing you to maintain a balanced diet and proper nutrition."
      },
      {
        "type": "p",
        "text": "3. Enhancing Aesthetics:Our smiles play a significant role in our self-confidence and how we present ourselves to the world. A chipped tooth can be a source of embarrassment and self-consciousness. By opting for a filling, you can restore the tooth’s natural appearance, ensuring a seamless blend with the rest of your teeth. This helps to boost your self-esteem and allows you to smile freely, without any concerns about the appearance of your teeth."
      },
      {
        "type": "p",
        "text": "4. Preventing Tooth Sensitivity:Chipped teeth can be accompanied by tooth sensitivity, especially when exposed dentin is involved. Dentin contains tiny tubules that connect to the nerves of the tooth, making it more susceptible to sensitivity to hot or cold temperatures. A filling can provide insulation to these sensitive areas, reducing or eliminating discomfort and allowing you to enjoy your favourite hot or cold foods and beverages."
      },
      {
        "type": "p",
        "text": "5. Cost-Effective Solution:Ignoring a chipped tooth may lead to more severe dental problems down the line, potentially requiring more extensive and expensive dental treatments, and the worst case scenario is a fracture that renders the tooth non-repairable. Addressing the issue early on with a filling can be a cost-effective solution, saving you from the potential need for more complex and costly procedures in the future."

        "type": "p",
        "text": "A chipped tooth might not always hurt but by promptly addressing the issue, you can prevent further damage, restore functionality, enhance aesthetics, alleviate sensitivity, and save yourself from potential future complications.

In this blog post, we will explore the importance of restoring a chipped tooth.Initially our patient came to us because they noticed their front two teeth were chipped, they thought it was due to accidentally biting on a fork. They only noticed an issue when someone else pointed it out to them, and they felt embarrassed because of it.This was our plan to restore the tooth to its original form.And after the proper polishing protocol, we were able to restore both teeth to their natural shape, colour, and feel.Another great benefit is there would be no freezing/numbing required (no injections, and no numb feeling for hours), and no sensitivity. There were only benefits here. The most impactful benefit for our patient was that they smiled more after the procedure, without feeling self-conscious. our goal is to restore the tooth to its original form, it requires a lot of patience, and being meticulous with the final polish to make sure we can deliver optimal results.Let’s review the main benefits below:1. Preventing Further Damage:The benefit of treating the thin, brittle enamel edge at this stage is to prevent further chipping of the edge – so instead of chipping more of the tooth, the bonding material would chip instead. There are microcracks that we don’t want to propagate, as they do not heal/seal on their own.2. Restoring Functionality:A chipped tooth can affect your ability to bite, chew, and speak properly. How many times has your tongue kept playing with a new filling, crown, or otherwise? The same can happen when a tooth is chipped – the tongue won’t leave it alone! By filling the chipped area, a dentist can restore the natural feel and function. This ensures that you can resume normal function without discomfort or limitations, allowing you to maintain a balanced diet and proper nutrition.3. Enhancing Aesthetics:Our smiles play a significant role in our self-confidence and how we present ourselves to the world. A chipped tooth can be a source of embarrassment and self-consciousness. By opting for a filling, you can restore the tooth’s natural appearance, ensuring a seamless blend with the rest of your teeth. This helps to boost your self-esteem and allows you to smile freely, without any concerns about the appearance of your teeth.4. Preventing Tooth Sensitivity:Chipped teeth can be accompanied by tooth sensitivity, especially when exposed dentin is involved. Dentin contains tiny tubules that connect to the nerves of the tooth, making it more susceptible to sensitivity to hot or cold temperatures. A filling can provide insulation to these sensitive areas, reducing or eliminating discomfort and allowing you to enjoy your favourite hot or cold foods and beverages.5. Cost-Effective Solution:Ignoring a chipped tooth may lead to more severe dental problems down the line, potentially requiring more extensive and expensive dental treatments, and the worst case scenario is a fracture that renders the tooth non-repairable. Addressing the issue early on with a filling can be a cost-effective solution, saving you from the potential need for more complex and costly procedures in the future.A chipped tooth might not always hurt but by promptly addressing the issue, you can prevent further damage, restore functionality, enhance aesthetics, alleviate sensitivity, and save yourself from potential future complications. Don’t hesitate to consult your dentist and take the necessary steps to preserve your oral health and smile.
